This Jenkinsfile represents a complete sample pipeline that simulates a typical
Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) process. Although it does not execute
real functional tasks, its purpose is to demonstrate how to structure multiple
stages and steps, including:

----------------------------------------
âœ… Highlights:
----------------------------------------
âœ… Building a Maven project
âœ… Simulated deployments to various environments (Dev, QA, Stage, PROD)
âœ… Execution of utomated tests using TestNG in different suites (Sanity, Regression)
âœ… Publishing reports (Allure, ChainTest)

----------------------------------------
ðŸŽ¯ Ideal for:
----------------------------------------
âœ… Practicing and understanding the structure of a Jenkinsfile
âœ… Seeing how to use commands such as bat, catchError, publishHTML, and allure
âœ… Simulating integration and testing pipelines in real-world environments
