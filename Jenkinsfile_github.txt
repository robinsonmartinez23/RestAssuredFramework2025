This Jenkinsfile simulates a full CI/CD pipeline across multiple deployment
stages (Dev, QA, Stage, PROD), but only uses a single test environment (-Denv=prod)
for all API test stages. This reflects a training or educational scenario where
different environments are not actually implemented.

----------------------------------------
âœ… Highlights:
----------------------------------------
âœ… Builds a simple Maven project from GitHub.
âœ… Runs automated TestNG suites: Sanity and Regression.
âœ… Deploy stages are simulated with echo statements.
âœ… Publishes Allure and HTML ChainTest reports.
âœ… Uses -Denv=prod in all test stages regardless of the stage name, since there is only one real environment.

----------------------------------------
ðŸŽ¯ Ideal for:
----------------------------------------
âœ… Learning how to structure real-world Jenkins pipelines using GitHub repositories.
âœ… Practicing report generation and error handling with catchError.
âœ… Understanding how pipelines can simulate multi-environment stages even with a single active environment.
